The following table shows the various services offered by a hair salon, including its prices and times required:Service Description Price ($) Time (Minutes)Cut 8.00 15Shampoo 4.00 10Manicure 18.00 30Style 48.00 55Trim 6.00 5Create a class that holds the service description, price, and number of minutes it takes to perform the service. Include a constructor that requires arguments for all three data fields and three get methods that each return one of the data field’s values. Save the class as Service.Create a second class called SalonReport which has three attributes:• A single-dimensional array that can hold five Service objects. Fill the array with the data from the table above.• Number of employees• A two dimensional array that will hold the number of each type of service each employee in the salon has conducted.SalonReport should have the following methods:• A constructor which takes the number of employees as a parameter• InsertService(int serviceNo, int employeeNo, int total) – the insert service method will take in the number of times a service was conducted for a particular service and employee. You can assume the numbers passed in for the service and employee are valid indexes for the 2D array.• calculateServiceTotalByEmployee(int serviceNo, int employeeNo) – returns the total amount earned for a particular employee and particular service. Like the last method, you can assume the numbers passed in are the index of the service and employee.• calculateServiceTotal(int serviceNo) – returns the total amount earned for a particular service for all employees. (Assume serviceNo is a valid index to the array).• calculateSalontTotal() – returns the total amount earned for all services for all employees.Test your two classes with the driver class provided :public class Tester02{public static void main(String[] args){SalonReport sr = new SalonReport(2);sr.insertService(0, 0, 2);sr.insertService(1, 0, 3);sr.insertService(2, 0, 3);sr.insertService(3, 0, 1);sr.insertService(4, 0, 2);sr.insertService(0, 1, 4);sr.insertService(1, 1, 2);sr.insertService(2, 1, 0);sr.insertService(3, 1, 2);sr.insertService(4, 1, 1);System.out.println(sr.calculateServiceTotalByEmployee(1, 0));/* Should print 12 */System.out.println(sr.calculateServiceTotalByEmployee(4, 1));/* Should print 6 */System.out.println(sr.calculateServiceTotalByEmployee(0, 1));/* Should print 32 */System.out.println(sr.calculateServiceTotal(1));/* Should print 20 */System.out.println(sr.calculateServiceTotal(3));/* Should print 144 */System.out.println(sr.calculateSalonTotal());/* Should print 284 */}}
